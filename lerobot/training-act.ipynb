        "# 🤗 x 🦾: Training ACT with LeRobot Notebook\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the **LeRobot ACT training notebook**! This notebook provides a ready-to-run setup for training imitation learning policies using the [🤗 LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) library.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example, we train an `ACT` policy using a dataset hosted on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/), and optionally track training metrics with [Weights & Biases (wandb)](https://wandb.ai/).\n",
        "\n",
        "## ⚙️ Requirements\n",
        "- A Hugging Face dataset repo ID containing your training data (`--dataset.repo_id=YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_DATASET`)\n",
        "- Optional: A [wandb](https://wandb.ai/) account if you want to enable training visualization\n",
        "- Recommended: GPU runtime (e.g., NVIDIA A100) for faster training\n",
        "\n",
        "## ⏱️ Expected Training Time\n",
        "Training with the `ACT` policy for 100,000 steps typically takes **about 1.5 hours on an NVIDIA A100** GPU. On less powerful GPUs or CPUs, training may take significantly longer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Output\n",
        "Model checkpoints, logs, and training plots will be saved to the specified `--output_dir`. If `wandb` is enabled, progress will also be visualized in your wandb project dashboard.\n"
